## Project Overview

Many student entrepreneurs operate small businesses on campus but struggle with limited visibility and marketing opportunities. Potential customers often do not know where to find these businesses or what services are available.

CampusPrenuer solves this problem by providing a digital space where students can easily present their businesses and connect with potential buyers within their campus environment.

The platform encourages collaboration, entrepreneurship, and economic participation among students.
